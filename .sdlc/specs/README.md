# Feature Specifications

This directory contains **per-feature specifications** organized by requirement.

## Purpose

Specs answer "What does this feature do?" They provide:
- Clear requirements with acceptance criteria
- Design decisions specific to a feature
- Atomic tasks for implementation
- Verification steps for completion

## Current Specifications

## Creating a New Specification

```bash
/req-new "Feature Name" --phase PHASE-NNN
```

Or manually:
1. Copy template: `cp ../templates/requirement.md REQ-NNN-name/requirement.md`
2. Add phase metadata to requirement.md
3. Create design.md, contract.md
4. Break work into tasks/TASK-NNN-*.md

## Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial requirements captured
2. **In Review**: Requirements under stakeholder review
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation
4. **In Progress**: Implementation underway
5. **Implemented**: All tasks complete, acceptance criteria met
