Ansible Policy & Modernization Engine — a multi-validator static analysis platform for Ansible content. It parses playbooks, roles, collections, and task files into a structured hierarchy, then fans validation out in parallel across independent backends to produce a single, unified list of violations.

## What APME is

APME is a **static and semi-static analysis tool** for Ansible content. It reads your YAML, reasons about structure and module usage, and reports what it finds — without running tasks or executing against target hosts.

It answers questions like:

- Will this playbook **parse** on ansible-core 2.19?
- Are any modules I use **removed, deprecated, or redirected**?
- Do my module arguments **match the argspec** for the version I'm targeting?
- Does my code follow **organizational style and security policies**?
- Are there **hardcoded credentials** in my project?
- What **migration work** is required to move from one ansible-core version to another?

## What APME is not

APME is not a test framework, a deployment tool, or a runtime verification system.

It cannot tell you whether a playbook will **achieve its desired outcome** on your infrastructure — that depends on target host state, inventory variables, network reachability, and runtime facts that only exist during execution. A clean APME scan means no *known* incompatibilities were detected — not that every runtime path will succeed.

**What still requires execution-time tools:**

| Concern | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Does the playbook produce the correct end state? | Molecule, integration tests |
| Is the playbook idempotent? | `--check` mode, Molecule |
| Do templates render correctly with real variables? | Integration tests |
| Does it work with my specific inventory and vault? | Staging dry-run |

APME and these tools are complementary. APME runs in seconds without infrastructure; execution-time tools validate behavior against real systems. Use both.

## Where APME fits

APME provides a **compatibility and quality floor**. It catches the preventable mistakes — the removed module, the broken `include:`, the wrong argument name, the committed secret — before they reach staging or production.

| When discovered | Cost |
|----------------|------|
| APME scan in CI | Developer fixes it in their branch |
| Syntax check in staging | Deployment blocked, team context-switches |
| Production run fails | Outage, incident response, postmortem |

For organizations managing hundreds of roles and collections across ansible-core version upgrades, this shift-left is the difference between a planned migration and an emergency one.

## Key features

- **Single parse, multiple validators** — parse once, fan out to independent backends
- **Parallel validation** — Native (Python), OPA (Rego), Ansible (runtime), Gitleaks (secrets), Collection Health, and Dependency Audit run concurrently; latency = max, not sum
- **100+ rules** — lint (L), modernize (M), risk (R), policy (P), and secrets (SEC) categories
- **Secret scanning** — 800+ patterns via Gitleaks with vault/Jinja filtering
- **Dependency health** — collection quality checks + Python CVE audit via pip-audit
- **Multi ansible-core version support** — session-scoped venvs per target version
- **Automated remediation** — deterministic Tier 1 transforms with multi-pass convergence
- **AI-assisted fixes** — optional Tier 2 escalation via [Abbenay](https://github.com/redhat-developer/abbenay) for violations without deterministic transforms
- **YAML formatter** — normalize indentation, key ordering, Jinja spacing with comment preservation
- **Structured diagnostics** — per-rule timing data (`-v` summary, `-vv` full breakdown)
- **Unified gRPC contract** — adding a validator means implementing one RPC

All inter-service communication is gRPC. The engine parses content once, then validators consume the hierarchy independently and in parallel. See the [architecture series](docs/architecture/) for the full pipeline walkthrough.

## Getting started

| Method | Best for | Guide |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **CLI** (`pip install`) | Quick evaluation, CI pipelines, single-user | [CLI Guide](docs/guides/CLI.md) |
| **Podman pod** | Development, full feature set (UI, AI, persistence) | [Deployment Guide](docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| **bootc VM** | Production single-node, atomic upgrades, systemd lifecycle | [bootc Guide](deploy/bootc/README.md) |
| **Helm chart** | Kubernetes / OpenShift production | [Helm Guide](deploy/helm/apme/README.md) |

### Try it now

```bash
pip install apme-engine@git+https://github.com/ansible/apme.git@v2026.4.1
apme check /path/to/your/project
```

The CLI automatically starts a local daemon with core validators (Native, OPA, Ansible) and Galaxy Proxy — no containers required. Optional validators (Gitleaks, Collection Health, Dep Audit) are not started by the daemon. See the [CLI Guide](docs/guides/CLI.md) for full usage, CI integration, and limitations compared to deployment methods.

### Remediation

```bash
# Deterministic transforms (Tier 1)
apme remediate /path/to/project

# Include AI-assisted fixes (Tier 2, requires Abbenay)
apme remediate --ai /path/to/project
```
